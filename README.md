## ✨ What is Doclite?

**Doclite** is a CLI tool that instantly creates or updates your `README.md` file by analyzing your:
- Project folder structure
- Git commit history
- Metadata and setup instructions (optional)
- And it respects your `.docliteignore` file!

Perfect for:
- Hackathon projects 💻
- Quick open-source setups 🌍
- Busy devs who forget to document 😅

npm install -g doclite
